# Dashboards

This page documents the key Datadog dashboards for monitoring Flight Shopping systems.

## Primary Dashboards

### Google Flights (GFS) Dashboard

<Card title="GFS Dashboard" icon="chart-mixed" href="https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/mdz-52s-9w3/google-flights-gfs">
  Main dashboard for Google Flights integration monitoring
</Card>

**URL**: `https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/mdz-52s-9w3/google-flights-gfs`

**What to monitor**:

| Panel | What to Look For | Healthy | Alert Threshold |
|-------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Search TPS** | Requests per second | 50-500 TPS | <10 or >1000 |
| **Latency p50** | Median response time | <200ms | >500ms |
| **Latency p99** | 99th percentile | <500ms | >2s |
| **Error Rate** | 4xx/5xx responses | <1% | >5% |
| **Cache Hit Rate** | Responses from cache | >80% | <60% |

**Key time ranges**:
- **2 weeks**: Trend analysis
- **1 week**: Week-over-week comparison
- **3 days**: Recent behavior

<Accordion title="Interpreting the Dashboard">
**TPS Drops** - Could indicate:
- Partner (Google) reduced traffic
- System issue preventing requests from arriving
- Rate limiting triggered

**Latency Spikes** - Could indicate:
- Cache misses forcing live searches
- Provider slowdowns
- Redis/database issues
- CPU/memory pressure

**Error Rate Increase** - Could indicate:
- Provider failures
- Invalid requests
- System bugs
- Cache failures

**Cache Hit Rate Drops** - Could indicate:
- External fare cache not refreshing
- TTL settings too aggressive
- New routes without cached data
</Accordion>

## Dashboard Best Practices

### Daily Check Routine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check GFS Dashboard">
    Open at start of day. Look for overnight anomalies.
    
    Time range: Last 24 hours
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Compare Week-over-Week">
    Switch to 1 week view. Check if patterns match previous week.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Note Anomalies">
    Document anything unusual in `#flights-dev-internal`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Provider Health">
    Identify any degraded providers
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Creating New Dashboards

When creating dashboards:

1. **Use consistent naming**: `Team - Service - Purpose`
2. **Add descriptions**: Explain what each panel shows
3. **Set alert thresholds**: Visual thresholds help spot issues
4. **Group logically**: Related metrics together
5. **Add links**: To runbooks and other dashboards
