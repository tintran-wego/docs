## Key Features

### Real-time Search

When a user searches for flights on Wego, our system:
1. Receives the search request (origin, destination, dates, passengers)
2. Fans out queries to relevant providers in parallel
3. Normalizes responses into a unified format
4. Aggregates and deduplicates results
5. Presents sorted results to the user within seconds

### Fare Caching

For instant results and better UX, we maintain several cache layers:

| Cache Type | Purpose | TTL |
|------------|---------|-----|
| **Live Cache** | Real-time search results | Minutes |
| **Provider Cache** | Raw provider responses | Minutes |
| **External Fare Cache** | Pre-fetched partner data (Atlas, GFS) | Hours |
| **Static Data** | Airlines, airports, routes | Days |

### Google Flights Integration (GFS)

One of our most important partnerships. Google Flights displays Wego's fares to millions of users:

- **Inbound**: Google sends fare requests, we respond with cached or live data
- **Performance Critical**: Strict latency and accuracy requirements
- **Revenue Driver**: Significant portion of flight traffic comes from GFS

<Info>
The GFS dashboard at [Datadog](https://app.datadoghq.com/dashboard/mdz-52s-9w3/google-flights-gfs) is essential for monitoring this partnership.

## Business Metrics

### What We Optimize For

1. **Search TPS** - Transactions per second handled
2. **Latency** - Time to first result, time to complete
3. **Coverage** - % of searches with at least one fare
4. **Price Accuracy** - Match between displayed and actual booking price
5. **Provider Success Rate** - % of provider calls returning valid results

### Revenue Model

Wego operates on a **CPC (cost per click)** model:
- Users search on Wego (free)
- Users click through to provider sites
- Providers pay Wego for the referral

This means:
- More searches = more opportunities
- Better prices = more clicks
- Faster results = better UX = more engagement
